				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Iterative approach using the same gauassion for randomization. I opted to try evaluating differnt
					types of changes indepenently to get a consistently higher score, but I had to improve the
					evaluation function and minimize the draw calls to get the
					results you see above.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p> Gonna just kinda list off the stuff I did. Made all images greyscale to minimize pixel evaluations.
					Majority of draws are done to a graphics buffer to avoid long expensive draw calls.
					only changed one variable at a time, I.E. only testing random changes to opacity, or color.
					Occasionally changing the bounds on the gauassion to bias either higher or lower.
					Selecting random subsets of circles and only changing those at any given time.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I had a lot of fun thinking of different ways to improve the program, either through more efficient
					code, or more simply an approch that would lead to consistently better
					scores. I'm very happy with how mine came out. It seems very good at low detail stuff but even with
					a higher detail image it does a great job breaking down features.
